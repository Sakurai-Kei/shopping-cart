<h1>Shopping Cart Project for TOP Javascript Course</h1>
<h3>Ideas for this project</h3>
<p>Using router to display multiple pages for a single page app</p>
<p>Using Typescript to get used to static type language style</p>
<p>Using react-bootstrap to try out new things</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>After doing this project, I realised that trying to learn using multiple new things at once such as TS, react-bootstrap and react-router can be hazardous. Due to this, the project is a bit unorganised. Although react-bootstrap offers some interesting component, I feel like doing it myself is better for flexibility.</p>
<p>All in all, I would definitely continue to use Typescript to get more used to it but I would not continue/use less react-bootstrap. I might give tailwind a try</p>
